Snipe
=====

ATDD spec generation tool. Converts plain text in Gherkin syntax into executable specs.

1. Write acceptance tests in the familiar Given/When/Then syntax.
2. From the command line, type 'snipe <inputPath> <outputPath>.
3. Drop the generated folder and test files into your Visual Studio solution.
4. Make the tests pass.

Your help in making this tool more awesome is most welcome.
